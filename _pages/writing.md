**Academic**

Recent essay titles include "To what extent do Foucault's ideas of governmentality and biopolitcs explain modern approaches to pandemic risk?", "How can sociological theories best explain DIY technology and its value in society?", and "What role does STS have to play in combatting vaccine hesitancy?".

I have also written about assorted pharmacology topics.

Please get in touch if you're interested in hearing more or reading any of these.


**Policy**

For the [Buchanan Institute](https://www.buchananinst.org/){:target="_blank"}, I have co-authored a policy paper discussing improving policy communication in times of crisis - this is due to be published soon.

My policy brief arguing for stronger genomic surveillance in the UK can be viewed [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_ZqWnbcLZP18Us9kxUI1Pr0_DSBb5ajHHPCTkp3bNms/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"} (written for [CERI](https://camxrisk.org/){:target="_blank"}'s Summer Research Fellowship).


**Journalism**

I [co-authored an article](https://www.varsity.co.uk/opinion/20589){:target="_blank"} in Varsity arguing that Cambridge's May Week should become a force for positive social change.

I've written some [short news articles](https://issuu.com/eusci/docs/issue_29_print/s/14622927){:target="_blank"}) for Edinburgh's science magazine EuSci, as well as a longer feature article about patient contributions to medical knowledge for BlueSci, the Cambridge science magazine (forthcoming).
