## Policy

For the [Buchanan Institute](https://www.buchananinst.org/){:target="_blank"}, I have co-authored a [policy paper](https://www.buchananinst.org/items/lessons-from-covid-19%3A-improving-policy-communication) discussing improving policy communication in times of crisis, based on learnings from Covid-19.

For [CERI](https://camxrisk.org/){:target="_blank"}'s Summer Research Fellowship, I wrote a [policy brief](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_ZqWnbcLZP18Us9kxUI1Pr0_DSBb5ajHHPCTkp3bNms/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"} arguing for stronger genomic surveillance in the UK. You can also watch me talk about it [here](https://youtu.be/vacMPy5N_2k){:target="_blank"}.

I [co-authored an article](https://www.varsity.co.uk/opinion/20589){:target="_blank"} in Varsity arguing that Cambridge's May Week should become a force for positive social change.
