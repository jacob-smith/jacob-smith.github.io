I'm a Masters student doing [Science and Technology in Society](https://www.sps.ed.ac.uk/study/postgraduate-taught-programmes/science-and-technology-society) at the University of Edinburgh. I recently graduated from the University of Cambridge with a BA in Natural Sciences, specialising in Pharmacology.

My main research interests are in catastrophic biorisk and pandemics, and I'm also into in science communication and drug policy.

I recently completed a research fellowship with the [Cambridge Existential Risks Initiative](https://camxrisk.org/), looking into genomic surveillance for pandemic avoidance.
