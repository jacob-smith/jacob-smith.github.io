I'm currently doing a Masters in [Science and Technology in Society](https://www.sps.ed.ac.uk/study/postgraduate-taught-programmes/science-and-technology-society){:target="_blank"} at the University of Edinburgh. I recently graduated from the University of Cambridge with a BA in Natural Sciences, specialising in Pharmacology.

My main research interests are in science policy (especially in the life sciences), mitigating biological risks, and the politics of DIY.

I recently completed a research fellowship with the [Cambridge Existential Risks Initiative](https://camxrisk.org/){:target="_blank"}, looking into genomic surveillance for pandemic avoidance - you can watch my presentation [here](https://youtu.be/vacMPy5N_2k){:target="_blank"}. You can find this and other writing [here](jacob-smith.github.io){:target="_blank"}.
