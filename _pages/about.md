I'm currently doing a Masters in [Science and Technology in Society](https://www.sps.ed.ac.uk/study/postgraduate-taught-programmes/science-and-technology-society) at the University of Edinburgh. I recently graduated from the University of Cambridge with a BA in Natural Sciences, specialising in Pharmacology.

My main research interests are in science policy, especially regarding pandemics and other biorisks. I'm also into science communication and the role of scientific knowledge in society more generally, drug policy, and occasionally urbanism.

I recently completed a research fellowship with the [Cambridge Existential Risks Initiative](https://camxrisk.org/), looking into genomic surveillance for pandemic avoidance - you can watch my presentation [here](https://youtu.be/vacMPy5N_2k).
