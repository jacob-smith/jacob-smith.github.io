**Work in progress - website built based on [academicpages](academicpages.github.io)**

I'm a Masters student doing [Science and Technology in Society](https://www.sps.ed.ac.uk/study/postgraduate-taught-programmes/science-and-technology-society) at the University of Edinburgh. I recently graduated from the University of Cambridge with a BA in Natural Sciences, specialising in Pharmacology.

My main research interests are in catastrophic biorisk and pandemics, but I'm also interested in science communication and drug policy.

This site mostly exists as a way for me to hold myself accountable to write more.
